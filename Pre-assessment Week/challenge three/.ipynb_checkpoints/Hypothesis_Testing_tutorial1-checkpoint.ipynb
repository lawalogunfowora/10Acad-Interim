    "# Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a critical tool in inferential statistics, for determing what the value of a population parameter could be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical hypothesis testing reflects **the scientific method, adapted to the setting of research involving data analysis**. In this framework, a researcher makes a precise statement about the population of interest, then aims to falsify the statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical hypothesis testing, the statement in question is the **null hypothesis**. If we reject the null hypothesis, we have falsified it (to some degree of confidence). \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the scientific method, falsifying a hypothesis should require an overwhelming amount of evidence against it. If the data we observe are ambiguous, or are only weakly contradictory to the null hypothesis, we do not reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basis of hypothesis testing has two attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Null Hypothesis: $H_0$**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Hypothesis: $H_a$**\n",
    "\n",
    "Various cases which are generally used in hypothesis testing are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One Population Proportion\n",
    "* Difference in Population Proportions\n",
    "* One Population Mean\n",
    "* Difference in Population Means\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation to compute the ***test statistic*** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$test\\ statistic = \\frac{Best\\ Estimate - Hypothesized\\ Estimate}{Standard\\ Error\\ of\\ Estimate}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After computing this _test statistic_, we ask ourselves, \"How likely is it to see this value of the test statistic under the Null hypothesis?\" i.e. we compute a probability value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on that probability, we either **reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis**. Note, we **do not accept the alternate hypothesis** because we can never ovserve all the data in the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type-I and Type-II errors\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework of formal hypothesis testing defines two distinct types of errors. A **type I error (false positive)** occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is incorrectly rejected. A **type II error** occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected when it actually is false. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most traditional methods for statistical inference aim to strictly control the probability of a type I error, usually at 5%. While we also wish to minimize the probability of a type II error, this is a secondary priority to controlling the type I error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us see some widely used hypothesis testing types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-test (Student test)**\n",
    "- **Z-test**\n",
    "\n",
    "**t-test**: The t test (also called Studentâ€™s T Test) compares two averages (means) and tells you if they are different from each other. The t test also tells you how significant the differences are.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of t-test:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One sampled t-test**\n",
    "- **Two sampled t-test**\n",
    "\n",
    "**One sample t-test**: The One Sample t Test determines whether the sample mean is statistically different from a known or hypothesized population mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create some dummy age data for the population of voters in the entire country (Senegal) and a sample of voters in Dakar and test the whether the average age of voters Dakar differs from the population:"
